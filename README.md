## 🧠 The Scoring System (and a little disclaimer!)

As you answer each question, your choices secretly build up scores in different traits:  
- **Protection** – How prepared or cautious you are  
- **Experience** – How much life adventure you’ve had  
- **Mindset** – How you think and approach situations  
- **Budget** – How you value and manage resources  
- **Contact** – How connected you are with people

Once your scores are in, the quiz matches you with one of our **8+ Personas** — from the strategic **Captain Backup** to the free-spirited **Fun Nomad**.  

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
> This quiz is **just for fun** and not based on any scientific personality model.  
> The scoring is playful and light — your result doesn’t define you, but it may give you a fun peek at how you approach life and money.
